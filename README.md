# Usage
This section describes the basic usage of the device

## Connecting the devices
* The Xsens IMU units are currently connected through the USB ports and should be connected before powering the device.
* GPS is connected to the UART pins. The device is enumerated as /dev/ttyAMA0 on RPi and /dev/ttyS4 on minnowboard and uses 57600 baud. This all is configured in the ROS launch files.
* It is recommended that the ethernet cable is plugged to a router which will assign an IP address to the device (unless using 3G), currently the OS has issues if you switch to a different router while the device is powered?
* The device gets time from internet, so logs are dated to 1970 or some other wrong time if no internet connection has been available before starting measurements

## Powering
* The device is powered by the powerbank from the USB connector. The runtime with this seems to be around 3-4 h for RPi and 2,5 h for minnowboard.

## Measurements
* The measurement mode is activated in the boot
* Primary led will flash when time is corrected from interney
* The device will start recording as soon as it loses internet connectivity
* It might take a few minutes to start the measurements, if there are errors with gps or imu. Device will try again until everything works.
* Primary led will flash when making IMU alignment, so IMU should be stationary that time and a bit after.
* It seems, the IMU wont start if it has been stationary for some time (MTw wired), so light shake might be needed before use.
* When recording, primary led will be lit.
* Recording will be stopped once the internet connectivity is restored.
* After being stopped, the files will be uploaded to Google Drive (tutopenkin@gmail.com)

## Shutting down
* The power switch on top can be flipped to give shutdown commands to the unit.
* After flipping the switch and waiting some seconds, the USB cable powering the device can be unplugged.

# Connecting to the device
Standard SSH conenction can be made to the device with ssh:

    ssh ubuntu@[IP]
    Password: ubuntu

For RPi with kinetic user: pi, password: raspberry
For minnowboard user: openkin, password: openkin

# Script startup
The measurements are started by running ~/openkin/start_script.sh, which in turn calls the main script at ~/openkin/measurement.sh using locks.
The script now starts from /etc/rc.local, with lockfile at /home/ubuntu/measurement.lock and as user ubuntu (or pi or openkin).
